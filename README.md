# Overview

This is a discord API that allows you to play card games with friends!

This was a project I wanted to do a while ago inspired by some friends of mine making card games in other languages.

I took on the challenge of making card jitsu from Club Penguin to start out with to see if I could get a simple yet complicated UI and standalone game that you can play online with friends.

The Bot can currently do the following:
```
    Has a help command that brings users to the documentation.
    
    Has a balance command to check your current balance.

    Has Daily, Weekly, and Monthly user claims to gain credits as you use the bot over time.

    You can start a game and it will create a server. Users can then look for the server using the proper commands and it will show all the servers with their given game code.

    When a user joins your game using /join (code), every player will be notified of the player joining the server.

    You can play a fully fledged out game online, cross server with friends of card-jitsu and uno.

    You can open card-packs for card-jitsu just like the good 'ol days and collect all the cards. You can view your deck, and even see how many cards you've collected and how many cards you need to collect from a given series.

# Future Work

- More card games to be made. i.e. solitaire, gofish, etc.
- Leveling up system to increase daily, weekly and monthly rewards.
- Rework into JavaScript to play in your DM's so I can eliminate making a million channels in a server.
