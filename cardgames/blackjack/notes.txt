start with 2 cards.
blackjack at 21 and 2 cards
you can't only see 2 of the dealers cards until it's the dealer's turn
you and hit whenever you want until you want to stop or you bust
dealer hits until they are >= 17 total
if player ties with dealer, money blackjack
if player is greater hand or dealer busts, player doubles their pot
if player is less than dealer hand, they lose their bid
if player gets blackjack, game ends and they get 4 times the pot
if player has 2 cards of the same value, they can split their hand into 2 hands, but they have to double their bid, so they need enough $$$
player can ask for insurance against the dealer if they show a value of 10
player can double down and get one final card face down until the dealer finishes their deal. The cards are then compared.
